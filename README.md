a software solution to make workflow easy

Linker is a simple, static project launchpad that brings all your important project links into one clean, distraction-free page.

Instead of searching through bookmarks, chats, and documents, you get one dashboard to access everything instantly.

Problem Statement

When working on a project, links are usually scattered across:
	•	Google Docs
	•	GitHub
	•	Figma
	•	Drive
	•	Slack / Discord

This leads to:
	•	Time wasted searching for links
	•	Context switching
	•	Unnecessary distractions

Solution

Linker solves this by providing:
	•	A single HTML file
	•	Large, clickable buttons for all essential links
	•	Clean UI using CSS Grid
	•	Zero backend, zero dependencies

Just open the page and start working.

How It Works
	1.	Identify 5–10 frequently used project links
	2.	Hardcode them into a single HTML file
	3.	Use CSS Grid to create a responsive layout
	4.	Open it in your browser or set it as a New Tab page
